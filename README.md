# SRGAN
Super-resolution GAN applies a deep network in combination with an adversary network to produce higher resolution images. As shown above, SRGAN is more appealing to a human with more details compared with the similar design without GAN.

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) offer a fix to these problems that are encountered due to technological constraints or any other reasons that cause these limitations. With the help of these tremendous GAN architectures, you can upscale much of the low-resolution images or video content you could find into high-resolution entities.
